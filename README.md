## About This Page
This Repository is used to organize all my projects from different languages, to make navigation easier for anyone who wants to see my work. 

## About Me
Learned Web development 6 years ago with basic HTML, PHP, Javascript, also learned the basics of VB.Net, Java, SQL in school but nothing too detailed, I don't have a degree in computer science, so most of my knowledge was acquired by myself using everything I could.
Later on decided to take Java Certifications, at the moment I finished the Z01-803 (Java OCA) and in the future will definitely take the Z01-804 (Java OCP).

## Current State
